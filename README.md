# py4web-blog-app

This 'blog' began as an attempt to see how difficult it would be to transition a code base from Django to py4web. After completing [Corey Schafer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) series on creating a blog app in Django, I took it upon myself to replicate the app in a different framework that I am closer to, which is py4web.

The point of this project is to display the code differences between the two frameworks and the different implementation guidelines that exist within each. Eventually I would like to create a video series following along in Corey's footsteps for creating this blog app, but for now, here is a good demo of what py4web can do.

The source code for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/agavgavi/py4web-blog-app), as well as links to [py4web's repo](https://github.com/web2py/py4web) and [Corey's repo](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog) for all proper credit.

Finally, I would like to recommend all that are interested to poke around py4web and see if there is anything you believe can be improved. The team working behind it has been just amazing and accepting of PRs as they come in.
